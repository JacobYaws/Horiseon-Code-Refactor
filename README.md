# Horiseon Webpage Code Refactor

## Description

For this project, I was tasked with refactoring code for a website to better optimize it for future use, as well as making it more screen-reader friendly.

## Overview

-In this code refactor, I changed all non-semantic HTML elements to semantic elements that correspond with where each element is placed on the page (i.e. If a section had navigational links, those elements were classified as 'nav'). 
-All images were given 'alt' attributes to describe the image in case someone were to use a screen-reader for the page. 
-All classes in the 'style.css' were given comments as to how it affects the elements in the 'index.html' file. 
-The title for the page was updated to look more like a normal title on any given webpage.
-The navigation links at the top of the page were fixed to take the user to the section of the page corresponding to the link.
-Classes in the 'style.css' file that had repeating specifications were consolidated together to make the file look more organized and shorter in length.
